Q1:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1:
Git init command initializes a repository by creating a hidden .git folder in which the metadata
of the git version control is stored. It is important to initialize a repository so that you could
push commits and have them all saved.

Q2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?
A2:
The staging area will only contain the files that has been added and not all the files from the working
directory. This is valuable because it offer great flexibility by allowing you to choose which files
do you wan to commit and which you don't.
