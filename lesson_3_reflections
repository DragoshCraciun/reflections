Q1:
When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all you work local?
A1:
Working local has it's advantages, but when you want to share your work with the public and/or also let contributors
make changes then I need to make your repository remote.

Q2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
A2:
I understand why I would always want to push changes manually rather then automatically but I found no information
about why I would like to pull changes manually rather then automatically. So I don't know what to answer here.
