Q1:
When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all you work local?
A1:
Working local has it's advantages, but when you want to share your work with the public and/or also let contributors
make changes then I need to make your repository remote.

Q2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
A2:
I understand why I would always want to push changes manually rather then automatically but I found no information
about why I would like to pull changes manually rather then automatically. So I don't know what to answer here.

Q3:
Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3:
Forks are clones that happen directly on github server. After forking a repository, it will be visible on your github
repositories page. Clones are full copies of a repository from the github server to ones local machine or from one
location to another location within the same local machine. Branches are "turn points" that you can do from any commit
that is checkout, from that point forward any changes made on that branch will be visible only on that branch.
